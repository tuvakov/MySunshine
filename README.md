# MySunshine
This project is a replica of Sunshine weather app in Udacity Developing Android Apps (ud851) course.
The repo for the original project can be found in this [link] (https://github.com/udacity/ud851-Sunshine).

## Goal
The main goal is to reflect the changes here without TODO guides to get better grasp of the concepts that are taught during the course.
And also practice some Git.
